        It is becoming increasingly more difficult to be able to properly be able to tell the truth online and off of it due to misinformation from both human, and AI sources.  
         Misinformation can be about anything, from a fake diet pill to propoganda by a government. It is especially easy to believe an erroneous statement with the sheer amount  of data consumed  
        online. Unconciously scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, or any social media in general leaves one incredibly vulnerable to information purported as "fact", that 
        very well may be completely made up. The purpose of this website is to educate and inform people about the different kinds of misinformation, and how to protect 
        oneself from it.

<span >In this example from <a href="https://www.thequint.com/international">The Quint</a> we can see a very 
    common kind of misinformation. The OP or "Original Poster" claimed that this shot of a man climbing down a 
    building is from an upcoming movie, named Jawan. However upon a little further research the footage is actually 
    from a stunt performed on Cat Tower for bengali film, Bagh Bandi Khela. </span>

   <span>Here we see another example of misinformation propogated online. This I found myself on Instagram
    from a page called airesearchs. They claim that an AI program called claude3 has gained sentience, however 
    this can not be correct as claude 3 is an LLM, or large language model. This means that 
    the program by default is unable to obtain sentience, it simply models responses based off an incredibly large database,
    it can never make something on its own.</span>
