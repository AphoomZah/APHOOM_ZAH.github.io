            <td>Pizzagate, or the erroneous belief that the NYPD discovered a pedophelia ring 
                involving many democratic party members. One of the alleged locations in the ring was
                comet ping pong, a D.C. pizza parlor. This misinformation actually led to a shooting, and several
                threats made to comet pizza and other alleged members of the ring.</td>
            <td>One of the main claims was that there was an underground network of tunnels
                in ping pong, however the picture used to proport this was proven to be a picture 
                of another location. In addition a picture of the owner of comet wearing a "j'♥ l'enfant" t- shirt (pictured right)
                meaning, "i ♥ the child", circulated. However this was actually a shirt referencing a bar
                named after Pierre Charles L'enfant, in addition it was not the owner wearing the shirt
                in the picture.

                gros micheal, a previously popular banana? This is in fact incorrect.
            </td>
            <td> In reality, it tastes so odd because the chemical used to flavor it, isoamyl acetate, is merely 
                one of the many that contribute to a real bananas flavor.

            <td>Online there has been claims that many impressive buildings today were actually remenants of a vast
                empire named Tartaria, or the Tartarian Empire. They claim that the empire was vastly technologically superior
                and was wiped away by mudfloods, and that its existence is being covered up. This theory is in all reality built on 
                pseudo scientific/historic theories, based on the previous historic name for  Central Asia, Tartary.
            </td>
            <td>Those who believe in this theory purport that buildings such as the US states customs house is actually a remenant
                of this empire, stating that it makes little sense as to how a mail office could be built so fantastically. They believe
                that its domes and great arched doorways were not meant for us, believing tall domes to be things contacting space,
                or that the archways were intended for tartarians, who were giants. However they do not realize that this "simple mailhouse" was a massive project on the federal 
                level, intended to sort and process the mail of at least 10 U.S states. In addition the initial design was actually a contest to improve 
                morale in South Carolina after the civil war. Theorists also use "evidence" such as many buildings having windows that are below ground,
                believing this to be evidence of the mud floods covering up parts of the buildings. However this is due to a lack of understanding of 
                architecture in previous decades. These windows actually were used either as fire escapes, or simply to allow natural light into underground areas
                before electric lighting was widely available.

            <td>In all reality peanut butter was used as early as the 15th century by the Incan and Aztec societies. In addition the first
                peanut butter patent was by John Harvey Kellogg in 1895. It is believed this misinformation came from an opinion piece

                to be incarcerated than U.S born residents. This study includes data taken from 1870 to 2020 by the U.S census bureau, a period of 150 years. </td>
