    <div id ="aboutMe"></div>
    <p style="text-align:center;">My name is Zachary Barineau and I am a student at University of West Georgia.<br>
        I am working towards a degree in cybersecurity, and have made this website to assist people <br> 
        in detecting and responding to misinformation. This is a very important skill to have especially <br> 
        when so many people are so regularly consuming information of all kinds from thousands of different<br>
        sources online. It can also help people to recognize and rectify misinformation in their <br>
        everyday lives. After all, you can only help your mind to grow if you monitor what you're <br>
        feeding it everyday.</p>
