    <div id ="aboutMe"></div>
    <p style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 35%">My name is Zachary Barineau and I am a student at University of West Georgia.
        I am working towards a degree in cybersecurity, and have made this website to assist anyone who uses the internet  
        in detecting and responding to misinformation. This is a very important skill to have especially
        when so many people are so regularly consuming information of all kinds from thousands of different
        sources online. It can also help people to recognize and rectify misinformation in their 
        everyday lives. After all, you can only help your mind to grow if you monitor what you're 
        feeding it everyday.</p>
