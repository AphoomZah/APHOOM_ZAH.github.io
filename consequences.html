<p>Now that we have established what misinformation is, and discussed the various types the important question of why this all matters is rasied.
The most basic outcome of course are incorrect, sometimes even dangerous beliefs based on this incorrect data. In addition Misinformation erodes trust in media outlets, institutions, and even personal relationships. How likely are you to believe what your friend says after they get it wrong a few times? 
This is exemplified even further in media and governmental bodies who are (rightfully) held to a much higher standard. Misinformation can also lead to significant issues with democracy, as it undermines
the truth of the democratic process and muddying the reality of election circumstances. In addition if the misinformation is in a field of study it may lead to the wasting of valuable time and 
resources, say in the case of a misleading conlcusion for a cancer treatment study that would never have worked in the first place. Resources would be wasted pursuing this 
incorrect path.

<h1 style = "text-align:center;">Where can we see the effects in the real world?</h1>
<div id ="Effectstxt">
<p>Have you ever heard someone claim that vaccines cause autism? This is in fact one of the most prevalent cases of misinformation still around to this day, and it can all be traced back to a single study in the 1990's.
In 1998 Andrew Wakefield published a study that erroneously suggested that the vaccines for measles, mumps,and rubella were linked to autism. This was immediately reviewed and found to be fake, as he had only used a sample size of 12 children, and had manipulated data from it. 
The shockwaves from this are still seen today, with many people refusing to innoculate their children due to one mans lying.</p>
