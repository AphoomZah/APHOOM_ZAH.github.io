    <h1 style="text-align:center;">What is Misinformation?</h1>
    <div id = "center">
    <p>Misinformation as defined by Oxford Languages is "false or inaccurate
        information, espcially that which is deliberately intended to decieve.", and it is a virulent disease online. From the 
        realm of social media, to google searches, to news articles, every single facet of online is filled with jabbering voices
        lying for one agenda or the other. This, paired with how much data people consume online on a daily basis makes for a dangerous combination.

    <h1 style = "text-align:center;">What kinds of misinformation are there?</h1>
    <div id = "center">
    <p>Misinformation appears in myriad ways, ranging from falsified news articles, to a rumor being passed around a school, to full blown conspiracy theories. It also appears
        in every possible type of media. Examples such as Ai generated videos and images, human edited videos and images, falsified data in studies, and information twisted to fit a certain narrative are some of the most 
        common types. However the two overarching types are, misinformation created by humans, and that created by computers or AI.

        <p style="flex-basis: 45%;margin-top: 0;margin-left: 5.5in; font-size: x-large;">Misinformation created by humans has been, until recently, the only kind of misinformation. That of coures raises the question of what the difference between it and AI misinformation is. It is any piece of media made with the purpose of manipulation or swaying someone to one viewpoint or another created by people. It will often use emotional triggers, societal biases, and appeals to individual agendas.<br>
         It is often the work of a single<br>
         group or person intending to<br> achieve
          one goal or another.</p>
        <p style="flex-basis: 45%;margin-top: 0;margin-right: 5.3in; font-size: x-large;">A new frontier of misinformation that relies on the abilities of computer algorithims to pump out misinformation on a scale impossible to humans. These algorithims are often running without human oversight, and generate every kind of falsifiable media possible from edited pictures, (such as the one pictured above)to voice recordings. While this technology may not be perfect yet it has been rapidly improving as demonstrated from the images below (taken from study done by stanford internet observatory).</p>
