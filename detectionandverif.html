<main>
<p style="margin-left: 5in; margin-right: 5in;">Now we know what misinformation is, and the consequences of it. The question still remains of what there is to be done about it. The best
thing to combat the spread of misinformation is to flood channels with good and trustworthy information. In addition information consumers should consume consciously, 
stopping to think about where they may be recieving information from, and if it is a reputable source. This is especially important on social media, as it allows people to consume vast amounts of
information in a short and easy format. It often does so without citing any sources, and many people simply do not check the veracity of what they are reading. The video below provides real world examples of combating 
misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
